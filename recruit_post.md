[A3][Recruiting][EU/US] ARCOMM - Casual Community, Serious Arma

ARCOMM is a welcoming community oriented group of like-minded players, first established in 2015. We utilize conventional tactics, but without the added fluff of ranks and saluting. However, we expect our members to be level-headed and intelligent when it comes to our in-game attitude. Always looking for excitement, fun, and teamwork in all of our missions.
